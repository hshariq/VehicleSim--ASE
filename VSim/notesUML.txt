Vehicle+ Simulation:

    Since simulation is made itself, it is not gonna be affected by vehicle

    and since one simulation can have many vehicles
    a simaultion can exist even if no vheicle

    it will hvae
    Vehicle 0..* -<>(aggregation) 1 Simulation

    - Simulation holds a List<Vehicle>.
    - Vehicles are added/removed dynamically (addVehicle(), removeVehicle()).
    - Vehicles are not destroyed automatically when Simulation ends — they can be created outside and passed in.
    - This matches aggregation semantics.
    - Simulation is the “whole” (it aggregates Vehicles).
    - Vehicle is the “part” (it belongs to a Simulation).
    - So the diamond should be drawn on the Simulation end of the line.



Vehicl + Grid:

    - Composition (filled diamond): Grid would own vehicles, and destroying the grid would destroy them. →  Not true here.
    - Aggregation (hollow diamond): Grid is a container of vehicles, but vehicles can exist independently. → Possible, but not quite exact since Grid doesn’t store vehicles directly, only references in a map.
    - Association (plain line): Vehicle uses Grid, and Grid knows about Vehicles. →This is the most accurate representation.
